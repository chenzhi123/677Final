###### Due: May 6 -- in the timezone of your choice.

The purpose of this assignment is to begin your self-learning journey in statistics. Pick one of the chapters listed below from the last two books we read this semester.

EDT: Herman Chernorr, Lincoln Moses, *Elementary Decision Theory*

CASI: Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, *Computer Age Statistical Inference*

- EDT - Chap 5
- EDT - Chap 6
- CASI - Chap 6
- CASI - Chap 7
- CASI - Chap 15

Prepare study notes for your chosen chapter and push them to a GitHub repo. Using Github for study notes provides an easy way to form self-study groups. For this assignment, your notes should include the following:

- Describe the chapter's main points with relevant comments, notes, and questions. 
- Investigate computational methods that are helpful in understanding, implementing, or extending the topics addressed. Consider, for example, demonstrating key computational elements by applying an R or Python package or by writing R or Python scripts.
- Write notes and explanations that address the mathematics underlying the material in the chapter. Include references you used as you read the chapter.
- Describe the historical context of the chapter's topics. Include references.
- What are the statistical practice implications of the material in the chapter?

Keep your notes briefâ€”7 to 15 pages. Cite all of your sources, including students in the class and chatbots. If you have spent more than 10 hours working on this assignment and are not close to finishing, come see me.
